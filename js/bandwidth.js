  this is only download estimation, obviously, in peer2peer default deployment, you will
  have full mesh, n*times both upstream and donwstream stream comming to you (which is bad, 
  but unless you have a server in between this is what it is). Remark: simetrical upstream/downstream
  is not common in DSL deplyoment, where downstream bandwith is much higher.
